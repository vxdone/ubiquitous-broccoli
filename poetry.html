    <h3> feel free to take your time in reading. like the playlist song choices, i carefully examined and chose these pieces carefully. </h3>
    <h3> hope they're to your standards! </h3>

    <p> <i> When a friend calls to me from the road <br>
And slows his horse to a meaning walk, <br>
I don’t stand still and look around <br>
On all the hills I haven’t hoed, <br>
And shout from where I am, What is it? <br>
No, not as there is a time to talk. <br>
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, <br>
Blade-end up and five feet tall, <br>
And plod: I go up to to the stone wall <br>
For a friendly visit. </i> </p>

    <p> i don't know if you know this, but <i> you </i> cheer me up on my bad days. <br> it's <i> you </i> that is a real one and sticks around. <br> and it's <i> you </i> that i'm willing to drop anything for and have a long conversation with. <br> you've done so much for me, so i want to return the favor back. <br> thanks for being my side :) </p>

Ever fully understand <br>
How you've touched my life <br>
And made me who I am. <br>
<br>
I don't think you could ever know <br>
Just how truly special you are, <br>
That even on the darkest nights <br>
You are my brightest star. <br>
<br>
You've allowed me to experience <br>
Something very hard to find, <br>
Unconditional love that exists <br>
In my body, soul, and mind. <br>
<br>
I don't think you could ever feel <br>
All the love I have to give, <br>
And I'm sure you'll never realize <br>
You've been my will to live. <br>
<br>
You are an amazing person, <br>
And without you I don't know where I'd be. <br>
Having you in my life <br>
Completes and fulfills every part of me. <br>

<td> <p> <i> this. </i> this just summed up what i wanted to say.<br> i never knew how to express these thoughts into words, but this just solved my answer. <br> i hope we can continue our friendship like this. <br> it's not often i encounter people of your caliber in my life. </p> </td>

    <td> A person who will listen and not condemn <br>
Someone on whom you can depend <br>
They will not flee when bad times are here <br>
Instead they will be there to lend an ear <br>
They will think of ways to make you smile <br>
So you can be happy for a while <br>
When times are good and happy there after <br>
They will be there to share the laughter <br>
Do not forget your friends at all <br>
For they pick you up when you fall <br> 
Do not expect to just take and hold <br>
Give friendship back, it is pure gold. </td>
