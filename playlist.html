  <h5> me when your mom ;) </h5>
  <h3> it's that time of the year again: new playlist! i've been working on this since july, so i hope it's to your standards. each song in this playlist underwent careful consideration by me. they each have a special meaning to me, so i hope you're able to pick up on them. if not, well... it just provides more evidence on your stupidity (/j). </h3>
  <h3> now why would i do this? well, it's simple: you're my friend. you've allowed me to feel happiness in this mundane and banal life of mine, so take it as a little token of my appreciation. </h3>
  <h3> take your time in listening to the playlist. you can lay down, close your eyes, and simply let the music take you away. </h3>
  <h3> if you want to access the playlist directly (which is recommended), you can click on the title text or the <i> beautiful, life-changing </i> image. </h3>
  <!-- <h3> oh and one last thing: if you want to make it easier on yourself, here's this google doc detailing the reasoning of my song selections lol. you can skim through it. </h3> -->
  <h3> hope you enjoy! sending lots of hugs and love :) </h3>
  <h4> ps: if you can't seem to access the spotify playlist, hmu on insta/discord. it's embedded onto this page, but spotify can be a bit tricky at times smh :/ </h4>
