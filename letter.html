  <h3> hey there you doo doo head. it's time for some smooshiness here. i'm going to just head straight into it, so prepare youself. i've warned you.</h3>
  <h3> i just want to start off by saying this: thank you. your existence truly changed my outlook on life. and no this is not a hyperbole, i mean it - for realsies. </h3>
  <h3> it's been a blast having you around. i still look back fondly on memories of us playing roblox together. i loved the utter chaos throughout each playing session and how we tried to compete against one another in ToH. </h3>
  <h3> (which. btw: i'm better at. i mean, just take a look at my ToH level. it's <i> unrefutable.</i>) </h3>
  <h4> (speaking of which we should play roblox again together some time. i would like to call for a rematch. no, you can't decline it. you are forced to oblige and accept my invitation. deal with it.) </h4>
  <h3> sorry for digressing there. anyways: you brighten up my dull days. whenever i was bored, tired, sad, or just meh, you would come around with your hilariously idiotic texts. just one glance of the message and i'm immediately laughing my head off. you're just way too reha. (in a good way; keep being you) </h3>
  <h3> i can't wait for us to go through high school together. there's so many things that i want to do with you (i already have a whole list), so you better have the stamina to keep up. but since you're reha, i doubt that... i mean you literally are so slow at running the mile (i ran in the spartan mile, so i can say this). </h3>
  <h3> but whatever! i'll drag you along, anyways. casey and olivia will be witnesses of your suffering too muhahaha >:) </h3>
  <h3> (omg i'm already thinking about us going to prom... man i would definitely beat you on the dance floor. just watch me, i'll be busting out some sick moves. casey and olivia will agree with me on this)</h3>
  <h3> ok but in all seriousness: i hope that our friendship doesn't end. i rarely encounter awesome people like you in my life, so i'm not letting you go (that sounds so weird out of context ew). please promise me that we'll keep in touch after we graduate. i want to continue bullying you more. </h3>
  <h3> hope you have a wonderful birthday, reha. spend some time with your family, do the things you love, and continue being yourself. you deserve everything good coming your way. </h3>
  <h3> cheers to another year of this crazy friendship, </h3>
  <h2> laura :] </h2>
